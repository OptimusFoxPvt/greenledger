Green-Ledger
A Decentralized Carbon Credit Marketplace
Green-Ledger revolutionizes the carbon credit market with blockchain technology, creating transparency and eliminating fraud while connecting corporations, SMEs, and individuals directly.
🌍 The Problem
The current carbon credit market suffers from:

Lack of transparency and trust
Fraud and double-counting issues
High costs that exclude SMEs and individuals
Poor liquidity and inefficient trading mechanisms

💡 Our Solution
Green-Ledger provides:

Transparency: Immutable blockchain records for complete verification history
Accessibility: Lower fees (1-2% vs industry 5-8%) for broader participation
Liquidity: Decentralized marketplace for easy trading
Gamification: Incentives for individuals to participate in eco-friendly activities

⚙️ How It Works

Project Verification: Third-party auditors verify carbon credit projects
Tokenization: Carbon credits are tokenized as GreenTokens (GT) on blockchain
Marketplace: Buyers and sellers trade GreenTokens directly
Gamification: Individuals earn GreenTokens for eco-friendly activities
