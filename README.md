Green-Ledger revolutionizes the carbon credit market with blockchain technology, creating transparency and eliminating fraud while connecting corporations, SMEs, and individuals directly.

## 🌍 The Problem

The current carbon credit market suffers from:

- Lack of transparency and trust
- Fraud and double-counting issues
- High costs that exclude SMEs and individuals
- Poor liquidity and inefficient trading mechanisms

## 💡 Our Solution

Green-Ledger provides:

- **Transparency**: Immutable blockchain records for complete verification history
- **Accessibility**: Lower fees (1-2% vs industry 5-8%) for broader participation
- **Liquidity**: Decentralized marketplace for easy trading
- **Gamification**: Incentives for individuals to participate in eco-friendly activities

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Project Verification**: Third-party auditors verify carbon credit projects
2. **Tokenization**: Carbon credits are tokenized as GreenTokens (GT) on blockchain
3. **Marketplace**: Buyers and sellers trade GreenTokens directly
4. **Gamification**: Individuals earn GreenTokens for eco-friendly activities
